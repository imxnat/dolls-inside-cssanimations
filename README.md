## dolls-inside-cssanimations

*Project made for practicing css animations.*

- I made this project by following [this tutorial ](https://platzi.com/blog/muneca-rusa-animaciones-css/) so I learn more about css animations and how to use them. Feel free to check the tutorial out and make your own.

## To learn more and understand better the properties used, I checked out this resources:
